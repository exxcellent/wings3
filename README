  What is wingS?
  -------------

  In a nutshell, wingS is a web application framework based on Java Servlets,
  resembling the Swing API with its MVC paradigm and event oriented design
  principles.


  Why wingS?
  ----------

  Though MVC and Swing are well established and well known, most web application
  frameworks on the market are still stuck in the paradigm of page-flow oriented
  design principles and require a heavy mixture of different technologies like
  XML, Java, JSP, Tag libraries, etc.
  This has heavy implications on the development process as it disables full
  reuse but requires to generate, write and maintain many different artifacts
  during the whole process. Think of JSP template files, XML based page flow
  descriptions, required form beans, and so on: All of these must be written,
  maintained and kept in sync for every dialog of your project.

  In contrast wingS offers a very efficient and sophisticated way to implement
  and design complex real-world applications in pure Java, enabling to fully
  leverage modern software design principles like inheritance, component-
  oriented design, refactoring and all the others without making a stop on the
  web tier.

  Therefore wingS provides an API for designing web applications which is nearly
  identical with the well proven Java Swing API for classical desktop-
  based applications.

  This similarity to the well known Java Swing API as well as the modern event-
  and component-oriented design principles of the wingS framework enable you and
  your development team to quickly focus fully on the implementation of your
  business-critical logic by simply (re)using well known (customized) components
  instead of being bothered with web tier details throughout the whole
  development process and during the maintenance lifecycle.

  Refer to the doc/tutorial/hellowings example for a very simple example of
  efficient and pure Java-based web application design with wingS!

  Beneath the very powerful approach of a pure Java API for web applications,
  wingS 3 also has some additional, outstanding features to offer, like:
    o Transparent AJAX
    o Powerful set of widgets including Trees, Tables, Menus, etc.
    o Highly flexible dynamic layout managers
    o Drag & Drop support (see WingSet)
    o Server-side code execution (DWR)
    o Component context menus
    o Handling of browser back navigation
    o and more

  For a quick overview of these feature you may want to take a look at the
  WingSet demo which is contained in this distribution or can be accessed
  online at the wingS website.
