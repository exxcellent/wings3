/**
 * Tries to simulate swing GridBag behaviour as close as possible.
 * <p/>
 * This layout is similar to Swing's GridBagLayout, though it can't
 * implement all functionalities because of the limitations of
 * HTML-table. It probably doesn't work exactly like its
 * Swing-counterpart - as a general hint: don't be too clever...
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * SComponents are usually added using an instance of
 * java.awt.GridBagConstraints which is copied while adding it (so you
 * might reuse it to add other SComponents). There are basically two
 * ways of adding: explicitly setting gridx and gridy or leaving
 * those at the default (RELATIVE) and let SGridBagLayout decide where
 * to put them. Normally they will be added horizontally, unless you
 * explicitly set gridx, which will add the SComponents
 * vertically. With setting gridy you can choose a row in which the
 * SComponents will be added. If you want to finish a row/column, you
 * can set gridwidth/gridheight to REMAINDER or RELATIVE - REMAINDER
 * marks the row/column to be finished while RELATIVE tells
 * SGridBagLayout that the <em>next</em> added SComponent will be the
 * last cell of the row/column which will always be placed at the end
 * (while the 'RELATIVE'-SComponent will be expanded to fill the gap).
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <em>Important:</em> When choosing a new row/column, the next
 * gridx/gridy-value that SGridLayout will choose will always be 0,
 * even if there is already a SComponent at that position. If you
 * really need to be clever, explicitly set gridx and gridy,
 * especially if you plan to dynamically add and remove SComponents.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The size of a cell can be influenced in two ways: either set
 * gridwidth/gridheight to a value larger than 1 to say how many
 * regular cells this cell should span or use weightx/weighty to tell
 * the browser how much of the empty space this cell should eat up
 * (e.g. if there are 3 cells with each weight=1, they will all get
 * 33%). The last method has two disadvantages: firstly, it uses the
 * deprecated width/height-parameters of the HTML-td statement and
 * secondly, it must be carefully used to get the correct result: all
 * cells of a row/column should have the same weighty/weightx or 0, so
 * it might be easier to set these values only in the first
 * column/row.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * GridBagConstraints has many more options than those described
 * above, but the current implementation can't use them.
